iRules project  is a platform that brings together a visual interface with exploratory learning content to facilitate learning fractions to the students and another intuitive interface to facilitate the making of artificial intelligent rules to the teachers, which they are worth to add intelligent support to the exploratory content and therefore help to the student. The importance of having made an interface to make rules from scratch will help teachers that they don’t have programming skills or technological background to improve the system intelligence and the student experience.

The making rules interface was properly designed considering a good interaction design to facilitate the teacher labour as much as possible. All this results on helping the student to navigate through the exploratory content with all support that the teacher has decided to apply by means of rules. To reduce on a simple sentence: more learning for students and simplicity of making support for the teachers.
